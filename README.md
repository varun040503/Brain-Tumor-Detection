# Brain Tumor Detection using Yolo V8

This repository showcases a project on Brain Tumor Detection using the Yolo V8 model. The aim is to detect brain tumors in MRI images, and the project utilizes the Roboflow website for dataset creation, annotation, model training, and validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm IDE
- Roboflow Account

### Project Setup
1. **Creating an Account:**
   - Sign up on [Roboflow](https://www.roboflow.com/).

2. **Setting Up Project Workspace:**
   - Follow the steps in the [Roboflow documentation](https://docs.roboflow.com/projects/create-a-new-project) to set up your project workspace.

3. **Creating Dataset:**
   - Use various methods to create the dataset, including selecting files, folders, YouTube video URL links, finding diverse datasets, and downloading images from Google Chrome or Kaggle.

4. **Annotation of Images:**
   - Annotate images using different tools available on the Roboflow website, such as drag tool, bounding box tool, polygon tool, smart polygon, label assist, and repeat previous.

5. **Training with Yolo V8:**
   - Train the dataset with the Yolo V8 model on the Roboflow website. Create versions, export datasets, and use the Yolo V8 model for training.

6. **Validation of the Model:**
   - Validate the trained model using various methods in the Roboflow website, including mean average precision, precision, recall percentages, and threshold levels for confidence scores.

7. **Running the Project in PyCharm:**
   - Run the project in PyCharm using Python. Explore different options like hosted API, on device (CLI, Docker, ESP stream), native SDK (Luxon, web browser), and utilities.

## Utilities

### Count Prediction
- Use the count prediction utility to predict the number of classes in an image.

### Other Features
- Explore additional utilities available in the Roboflow website, including annotation predictions, blur predictions, counting zones, count across lines, and more.
